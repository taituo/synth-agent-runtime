# Known open items

Deliberately unfinished work, recorded so it is not silently dropped. Each item
says what is open, why it is still open, and what closing it needs. Items are
removed only when the closing work lands.

## Egress and artifacts


## Measurement

- **The corpus is a smoke test, not a benchmark.** The four `cve-*` items were
  moved to `ambiguous` (a vulnerability report is both `news` and `incident`),
  so the scorable set is 8 items; all three measured models score 8/8 = 1.0
  (`CORPUS_BASELINE`). Eight items is too few to gate on meaningfully — 7/8 =
  0.875 already fails a 0.9 gate, so the gate detects regressions, not
  capability. Closing: a corpus on the order of 100+ items, balanced across
  classes, with labels agreed by more than one annotator and the ambiguous set
  reported separately.

## Inference and scheduling

- **OpenRouter limits/prices are UNMEASURED and stay labelled so.** The quota
  spec (external, `/tmp/opencode/spec-quota-aware-retry.md`) states "20
  requests/minute and 50/day" and per-million prices as facts, with no artifact
  behind them. We do not have an `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, so we cannot measure
  them. They must not be cited as measured; the driver itself skips with exit 2
  when the key is absent. Closing needs a real key and a run that records the
  observed headers and cost — until then the numbers are unverified claims, not
  results.
- **Rate-limit scope: no practical limit binds at our scale (measured).** The
  probe (`npm run live:rate-limit-scope`) sustained **1000 concurrent** calls to
  one cheap model: 998 returned 200 in ~20s (~50 req/s), 2 returned a transient
  5xx ("Stream ended without finish_reason" / "503 status code (no body)"), and
  there were **zero 429/402 responses and no rate-limit headers**. A second
  model was unaffected immediately after. So the provider did not throttle at
  ~3000 req/min-equivalent on this tier, and the observed failures are transient
  provider errors under a huge simultaneous burst, not rate limiting. Per-model
  vs shared stays undecidable without ever hitting a limit; one account also
  makes per-account and per-provider indistinguishable. Consequence: adaptive
  concurrency is **deprioritised** — do not build a controller for a constraint
  that does not bind. Revisit only if a limit appears at higher sustained load
  or on a paid tier.
- **Adaptive concurrency is deprioritised, not built.** `LaneScheduler` takes a
  fixed capacity, but the rate-limit-scope measurement found no practical limit
  at our scale (1000 concurrent, no throttle), so an AIMD controller would have
  nothing to discover. Revisit only if a limit appears; the measurement is in
  the rate-limit-scope entry above.
